Welcome to Museum Audio Guide's documentation!
==============================================

The goal of this project is to provide museums and other public places with audio-guides via visitor's phones or other devices.

Visitors can start at the beginning with an index (e.g. a museum entrance) or at any exhibit.
Each exhibit is tagged with a Stop Number (unique within a room) and a QR Code.  Visitors point their cameras at any QR code to load the app the first time.
From there, they can navigate to a stop, or point at the QR Code.  They can then begin listening to the information about that piece, and/or read me.

Administration:
===============

The administrative portal allows managers to create rooms and exhibits, upload photos, audio and text.  After previewing an exhibit, the manager can "publish" it, so that it's available on the app.  A PDF is provided to print for display next to the exhibit.
